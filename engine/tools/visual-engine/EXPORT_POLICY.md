### SVG canonical · PNG convenience · HTML self-contained · 2026-08-08 · v1.0.0

| Format | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **SVG** (SSR) | **canonical** | deterministic, id-normalized, aria-labeled, provenance-stamped (`content-sha256`), embeds in docgen HTML/PDF and markdown |
| **PNG** | convenience | rasterized from the canonical SVG via @resvg/resvg-js at 2× width; system-font dependent → per-host deterministic only; never the archival format |
| **Interactive HTML** | first-class for exploration | fully self-contained (echarts.min.js inlined, zero CDN — docgen law), includes the static SVG as `prefers-reduced-motion`/`print` fallback, text summary as figcaption |
| **PDF embed** | via docgen/weasyprint | embed the SVG in a docgen document; print-theme recommended |

Rules: every export of a source-of-truth visual keeps its job JSON + evidence
file next to the render hash (Gate G8/G9). Static meaning must equal
interactive meaning — the HTML template renders the SAME option object, only
with animation re-enabled. Renders land in `renders/current/` (gitignored)
except golden fixtures in `renders/golden/` (committed).
